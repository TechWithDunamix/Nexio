# Simple Hello world example

> Here's the simplest Nexios app you can makeâ€”it's just one file. This is different from what you'd get with the Nexios CLI tool, which sets up a full app with multiple Python files and folders for different tasks.



```python

from nexios import NexioApp

app = NexioApp()
@app.route("/api/endpoint",methods = ['get'])
async def endpoint_handler(request, response):

    response.json({
        "text":"Welcome to nexios
    })

```


# Running Locally

 
1. ensure you have followed the  [Installation guide](installation.md)

2. Just like other python asgi frameworks(Fastapi,etc) Nexios uses uvicorn as it the server , you can run it as below

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

- The main should be the name of the file the app is located at 
- The app should be the nexioapp instance 
- the reload flag ensure the server listens for changes in your files
