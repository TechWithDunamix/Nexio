Here’s a detailed, conversational guide to incorporating **Tortoise ORM** into the Nexio framework, tailored to sound like you:

# Integrating Tortoise ORM into Nexio Framework  

Tortoise ORM is an excellent choice when you need async database handling for modern Python projects. It’s simple, intuitive, and plays nicely with Nexio's asynchronous core. Whether you're building with SQLite for a quick prototype or scaling to Postgres or MySQL, Tortoise has you covered.  

For those who want to dive deep, check out the [official Tortoise ORM documentation](https://tortoise-orm.readthedocs.io).

## Why Tortoise ORM?  

Think of Tortoise as the async-first ORM for Python—it’s lightweight yet powerful, with support for migrations, relationships, and all the database essentials. It keeps the focus on clean, Pythonic code and makes interacting with your database straightforward.  

### Core Features  
- **Async-first design:** Perfect for frameworks like Nexio.  
- **Rich relationships:** Supports foreign keys, many-to-many, and more.  
- **Migration-ready:** With tools like Aerich, migrations are a breeze.  
- **Multi-database support:** SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL—your choice.

## Setting Up Tortoise ORM  

Before jumping in, make sure Tortoise ORM and its dependencies are installed. It's the foundation for everything.  

```bash  
pip install tortoise-orm aerich  
```  

If you’re using Postgres or MySQL, add their drivers too:  
- For **PostgreSQL**: `pip install asyncpg`  
- For **MySQL**: `pip install aiomysql`  

SQLite works out of the box, no extra installation required.  

---

## Adding Models  

Models in Tortoise are just Python classes that map directly to database tables. Let's say we’re working on a `User` model.  

Create a `models.py` file and add this:  

```python  
from tortoise.models import Model  
from tortoise import fields  

class User(Model):  
    id = fields.IntField(pk=True)  
    username = fields.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True)  
    email = fields.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)  
    created_at = fields.DatetimeField(auto_now_add=True)  

    def __str__(self):  
        return self.username  
```  

This is straightforward. Each class represents a table, and fields like `IntField` and `CharField` represent columns. Relationships like foreign keys and many-to-many are just as easy.

## Configuring Tortoise ORM with Nexio  

To hook Tortoise into Nexio, you’ll need to initialize it as part of the app lifecycle. Configuration happens once during startup and stays ready throughout the app's lifetime.  

Start by defining an init function for Tortoise in your app:  

```python  
from tortoise import Tortoise  

async def init_tortoise():  
    await Tortoise.init(  
        db_url="sqlite://db.sqlite3",  # Replace this with your database connection string  
        modules={"models": ["models"]},  # Tell Tortoise where to find your models  
    )  
    await Tortoise.generate_schemas()  # This sets up the database schema if not already created  
```  

Then call this function in Nexio’s app lifecycle, such as during app initialization or startup events.  

---

## Performing Database Operations  

With everything wired up, using Tortoise feels natural. For instance, creating and querying users might look like this:  

```python  
from models import User  

# Create a new user  
await User.create(username="Dunamis", email="dunamis@example.com")  

# Fetch all users  
users = await User.all()  
print(users)  

# Filter users  
specific_user = await User.get(username="Dunamis")  
print(specific_user.email)  
```  

Notice how clean and async-friendly the operations are. You’re working with Python objects while Tortoise handles the SQL under the hood.  

---

## Migrations with Aerich  

For migrations, Aerich is the go-to tool with Tortoise ORM. It manages schema changes effortlessly. Once Aerich is installed, initialize it for your project:  

```bash  
aerich init -t settings.TORTOISE_ORM  # Adjust path to your Tortoise config  
```  

To create migrations and apply them:  
```bash  
aerich migrate  
aerich upgrade  
```  

This ensures your database stays in sync with your models.

## Wrapping Up  

Tortoise ORM transforms the way you interact with databases in async environments, and pairing it with Nexio feels seamless. With its clean syntax and async capabilities, it makes database operations effortless.
